# Spring MVC Project

##This is a simple Spring MVC project for managing a list of people. It includes basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and uses Thymeleaf as the templating engine.

**First of all ou need to clone the repository, after that:**

**1. Build the project:**  
   'mvn clean install'  

**2. Run the project:**  
  'mvn spring-boot:run'  

**3. Open your browser and visit http://localhost:8080/people to access the application.**  


Dependencies
Spring Boot
Thymeleaf
PostgreSQL (You need to have a PostgreSQL database set up with the appropriate configurations in application.properties)

Now you can explore and modify the project according to your needs! I would be glad to receive comments and suggestions :)
